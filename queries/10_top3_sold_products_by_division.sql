   Ad-hoc Request 10: Top 3 Products by Division (FY2021)
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Objective:
   Identify and rank the top 3 products within each division 
   by total sold quantity in FY2021, giving leadership insight 
   into the best-performing products per division.

   Input Tables:
   - fact_sales_monthly
   - dim_product

   Expected Output:
   - division
   - product_name
   - total_sold_quantity
   - division_rank (1â€“3 within each division)

   Key Insight:
   - Each division is dominated by a small set of products 
     (e.g., Pen Drives in N & S divisions).  
   - PC division shows weaker product performance compared to 
     Accessories and Notebooks.

   Recommendation:
   - Reinforce top-performing products to sustain divisional sales.  
   - Reassess strategy for divisions with low-performing products 
     (e.g., PC division).  
   - Encourage diversification to avoid over-reliance on a single SKU.
